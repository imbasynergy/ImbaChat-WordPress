At the moment there is no such function. Also this is pointless, because only authorized users can chat with each other.

=Will the chat load my server?=
The chat on Saas version is connected as a widget and therefore does not load the server. All the load and data processing takes place on our servers, they can withstand a fairly heavy load, so you don't have to worry about the load.
