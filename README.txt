== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=I have installed the chat plugin and set it up but the chat window isn't visable.
Try to turn on Jquery load at the Dashboard at ImbaChat website in widget chat settings and check it again.

=Can I use this plugin on a Shared hosting?=
Yes, our plugin is available even on shared hosting.

=If my website does not have login mechanism, then will i be able to use imbachat?=
At the moment there is no such function. Also this is pointless, because only authorized users can chat with each other.

=Will the chat load my server?=
The chat on Saas version is connected as a widget and therefore does not load the server. All the load and data processing takes place on our servers, they can withstand a fairly heavy load, so you don't have to worry about the load.

=How much does it cost?=
The ImbaChat is working as Freemium. The basic functions like group and private chat are free. You can learn more about ImbaChat pricing [here](https://imbachat.com/en/pricing).

=Do I have to install any hardware/software on my premises to use this widget?=
ImbaChat is a hosted, cloud based video aND text chat service. It does not require you to install any additional hardware or software. Simply configure the plugin to suit your preferences and you should be up, and running in minutes.

=Does ImbaChat have an affiliate / partner program?=
Yes, anyone can participate in ImbaChat affiliate program and earn money online. [Here](https://imbachat.com/en/referal-programm) you can learn all about this program.

=Why does not the videochat work? I see the buttons but I do not get any prompts for video access.=
Browsers require a secure connection (HTTPS) for accessing a deviceРІР‚в„ўs microphone and camera. When testing locally, localhost is a whitelisted URL but once you deploy to production you will need to have a secure connection for the plugin to function properly.
