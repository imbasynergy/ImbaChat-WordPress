== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=I have installed the chat plugin and set it up but the chat window isn't visable.
Try to turn on Jquery load at the Dashboard at ImbaChat website in widget chat settings and check it again.

=Can I use this plugin on a Shared hosting?=
Yes, our plugin is available even on shared hosting.

=If my website does not have login mechanism, then will i be able to use imbachat?=
At the moment there is no such function. Also this is pointless, because only authorized users can chat with each other.

=Will the chat load my server?=
The chat on Saas version is connected as a widget and therefore does not load the server. All the load and data processing takes place on our servers, they can withstand a fairly heavy load, so you don't have to worry about the load.

=What are the server requirements?=
There is no special requirements for the Saas version. But If you want to install the Pro version, your server must have at least 2 GB of RAM.
