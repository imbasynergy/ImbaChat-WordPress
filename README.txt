== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Can I use this plugin on a Shared hosting?=
Yes, our plugin is available even on shared hosting.

=If my website does not have login mechanism, then will i be able to use imbachat?=
At the moment there is no such function. Also this is pointless, because only authorized users can chat with each other.

=Will the chat load my server?=
The chat on Saas version is connected as a widget and therefore does not load the server. All the load and data processing takes place on our servers, they can withstand a fairly heavy load, so you don't have to worry about the load.

=What are the server requirements?=
There is no special requirements for the Saas version. But If you want to install the Pro version, your server must have at least 2 GB of RAM.
